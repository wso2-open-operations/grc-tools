"""
Coverage for `GET /api/evidence/{evidence_id}/download` (spec issue #92): a
zip of one Evidence's files, ordered, named and folder-nested so a reviewer
can extract several of these and get a correct
`product/framework/control/evidence-title/` audit-pack hierarchy back --
unlike clicking each signed-link screenshot individually, which loses the
order, the Control hierarchy and the readable name (all lost once the
browser is left holding only the blob's own UUID basename).

Authorization is reused, not reinvented: the route calls the exact same
`_authorize_evidence_access` (`app/api/routes/evidence.py:16`) that
`get_evidence` and `delete_evidence` already use, so it is covered here only
to the extent of confirming it is actually wired up and that it runs *before*
any blob is read -- not to re-litigate the rule itself (see
test_evidence_ownership.py / test_evidence_deletion_authorization.py for
that).

See ADR 0003 and the spec's "Relationship to ADR 0003" section for why this
authenticated, per-Evidence bulk download does not reopen the question that
removed the old unauthenticated `/uploads/{filename}` proxy route.

# issue #90). That makes the download cross-origin, and CORS hides every
# response header from the page except a short safe-list that

# no filename and saves the archive as `evidence-{id}.zip`, silently undoing
# the naming the rest of this module exists to get right.
