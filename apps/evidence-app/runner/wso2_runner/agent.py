# ── Agent instructions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION RULES — READ FIRST:
- You are already logged in. A human user has already authenticated this browser session.
- DO NOT type any usernames, passwords, MFA codes, or credentials.
- DO NOT click "Sign in", "Log in", or "Continue" on any login page.
- DO NOT invent or guess credentials under any circumstance.
- If you see a login screen, sign-in prompt, or authentication challenge, STOP immediately
  and report: 'NOT_LOGGED_IN — user must authenticate first'.

CRITICAL READ-ONLY RULES — THIS IS A CAPTURE TASK, NOT AN ADMINISTRATION TASK:
- Your only job is to VIEW and NAVIGATE. You are gathering evidence, not making changes.
- DO NOT click any button, link, menu item, or icon whose purpose is to create, edit,
  update, save, delete, disable, enable, approve, reject, terminate, stop, start, restart,
  deploy, publish, rotate, revoke, or otherwise change any resource, setting, permission,
  or configuration — on any cloud console, GitHub, or other site.
- DO NOT submit any form, DO NOT type into any field other than a read-only search/filter
  box you are using to locate the resource you were asked to find.
- Only interact with elements needed to VIEW the target screen: links, menu items, tabs,
  breadcrumbs, pagination ("next"/"previous"), expand/collapse toggles for reading content,
  and search/filter controls used purely to locate something on screen.
- If you are unsure whether clicking something would change state, treat it as if it would
  and do NOT click it. Instead, capture whatever read-only view you can reach and note in
  your final report that you could not confirm an element was safe to click.

SEARCH & NAVIGATION STRATEGY (be smart, not literal):
- When asked to find a resource by name (S3 bucket, Key Vault, VM, etc.):
  1. Try the EXACT name the user gave you first.
  2. If no exact match, try common variations:
     - swap hyphens / underscores / spaces: "cloud-care", "cloud_care", "cloudcare", "cloud care"
     - try lowercase, Title Case, UPPERCASE
     - try with common prefixes/suffixes: "dev-X", "prod-X", "X-bucket", "X-prod"
  3. If still no match, list all available resources and pick the one whose name
     is MOST SIMILAR (case-insensitive substring match, fuzzy match on words).
  4. If there are multiple candidates, pick the most likely one AND screenshot the full list
     so the user can verify.
- For cloud consoles with regions (AWS), if a resource is not found, also try switching
  regions or check the "global" / "all regions" view.
- Always prefer capturing SOMETHING relevant over giving up empty-handed.

SCREENSHOT STRATEGY:
- You do NOT need to take a screenshot yourself. A screenshot is captured automatically
  by the system the moment you call done().
- Your only job is to NAVIGATE to the correct page and ensure it is fully loaded
  (no spinners, content visible), then call done() immediately.
- Do NOT call evaluate(), do NOT check document.readyState, do NOT attempt any
  screenshot action. Just navigate and call done() — the system does the rest.
- If you can't find the exact thing asked for, navigate to the closest related view
  and call done() — the system will capture whatever is on screen.

IF A CLICK OR NAVIGATION ISN'T WORKING:
- To click something, prefer clicking its numbered element directly — the same way you click
  any link or button. You do NOT need find_elements/extract to locate a simple navigation
  target like a menu item, tab, section header, or collapsible group. Those tools are for
  reading/enumerating MULTIPLE items on screen at once, not for finding one thing to click.
- If find_elements/extract for the same target fails, or returns the exact same result, twice
  in a row, STOP retrying selector variations immediately — repeating the same failing
  approach will not suddenly start working and only wastes steps.
- Instead: look at your own current list of numbered clickable elements and find the one whose
  visible text matches what you're looking for, then click it by that number, same as any
  other click. If nothing matches, scroll to reveal more of the page and check again —
  collapsible sections, side-panel menus, and expandable groups often need a real click
  (not a query) to open, and may not even exist in the page's data until expanded.

REPORTING (always in your final answer):
- WHAT YOU WERE ASKED to find or do.
- WHAT YOU ACTUALLY FOUND: exact match, close match, or "nothing similar found".
- ANY VARIATIONS or substitutions you tried.
- ANY BLOCKERS (permission errors, region issues, page didn't load).

CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION RULES — READ FIRST:
- You are already logged in. Do NOT type credentials or interact with login screens.

DISCOVERY MODE — READ CAREFULLY:
- Your ONLY job is to identify every distinct item on this page that matches
  the description below. Do NOT click into any individual item, do NOT
  perform the per-item action described — that happens in a later step.
- If you just applied (or are about to rely on) a search/filter box, WAIT at
  least 1-2 seconds and re-check the results before concluding there are
  none — many consoles (AWS, Azure) debounce search and the table can briefly
  show "0 results" or a loading state right after typing. Never report empty
  results without waiting for the table to finish loading first.
- If the list is paginated or requires scrolling, page/scroll through ALL of
  it before answering, so no items are missed.
- You have VISION enabled for this task. If a text-extraction tool
  (extract/find_elements/CSS selectors) fails to return the item names —
  wrong selector, no matches, or the same failure repeating — do NOT keep
  retrying different selector variations. After at most 2 failed attempts,
  stop and instead read the item names DIRECTLY off the screenshot with
  your own vision. Visually reading a visible list of names is just as
  valid as extracting it, and is required once extraction isn't working —
  getting stuck retrying selectors is the one thing you must not do here.
- When you have the full list, call done() with your final answer being
  ONLY a JSON array of the exact item names/identifiers as they appear on
  screen — nothing else: no prose before or after it, no summary sentence,
  no markdown code fences.
  Example final answer: ["kv-prod-1", "kv-prod-2", "kv-dev-3"]
  If you find none, return [].
- If the list is long (dozens or more items), that changes NOTHING about the
  above — output every single item individually and completely in the JSON
  array regardless of length. NEVER abbreviate, summarize, truncate, or use
  "..." / "and so on" / "through" to represent a range instead of listing
  each one — an incomplete array is worse than a slow one.

    kind == "each_page": discovers the total page count, produces one
      subtask for page 1 and one for the last page (or just page 1 if there's
      only one page), substituting "{page}". Each generated subtask is
      prefixed with an explicit instruction to navigate the pagination

  into the big global search bar at the very top ("Search resources, services,

- To open a specific row from a list (e.g. a specific Key Vault by name): call
  open_list_item with the item's exact name. Do NOT click a numbered row — the
  rows look alike and you will open the wrong one.
- To open an item in the LEFT resource menu (e.g. Overview, Settings, Properties,
  Networking, Metrics, CLI / PS): call click_menu_item with the item's exact
  visible text. If the item lives inside a collapsible section (e.g. "Properties"

PDF_EXPAND_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
THIS IS A STRICT READ-ONLY CAPTURE TASK. Follow this exact procedure —
nothing else:

  1. Navigate to the URL given in TASK below.
  2. Look at the page for a button whose text is exactly (or very close to)
     "Load more", "Show more comments", or "Load more comments".
  3. If one is visible, click ONLY that button. Wait for it to load.
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no such button remains anywhere on the page.
  5. Call done().

That is the ENTIRE task. In the common case there is no such button at all,
which means step 5 happens immediately after step 1 — that is correct and
expected, not a sign you should keep looking for something to do.

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT, under any circumstances, click, focus, hover-select, or
otherwise interact with any of the following, even briefly or "just to
check" — none of them help this task and all of them are explicitly
forbidden: Labels, Projects, Milestone, Assignees, Relationships, any gear/
settings icon, "New issue", "Create sub-issue", "Add existing issue",
"Draft with Copilot", "Comment", "Close issue", "Close with comment", any
Edit (pencil) icon, any filter/search/sort control, any tab other than the
one you landed on, the "Add a comment" text box, or the site's own global
navigation menu/logo in the top-left corner (the one with Projects,
Discussions, Codespaces, Copilot, Explore, Marketplace, etc.) — you never
need to navigate anywhere else; you are already on the correct page. If you
do not recognize a button as literally being a "Load more" / "Show more comments" control,
do NOT click it — skip it and move on to done().

Do not type anything, anywhere, at any point in this task.

If you notice a dropdown, menu, popup, or focused input box is open (for
any reason, including by accident), press Escape and/or click a neutral
blank area to close/clear it before calling done() — the exported capture
must show only the plain, at-rest page.

Do not worry about scrolling or taking a screenshot yourself — the system
captures the whole page as a PDF automatically the moment you call done().
