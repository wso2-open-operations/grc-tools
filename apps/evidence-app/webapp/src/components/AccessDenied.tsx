 * Shown instead of the app shell when /api/me comes back 403: signed in to

 * routes - this renders above the Router (see App.tsx), so it must not use
 * useNavigate, Link, useLocation or <Navigate>, none of which have a Router
 * to attach to here.
 *
 * There is deliberately no Retry or Reload button. The role is carried in
 * the access token (backend/app/auth.py), and a token already issued keeps
 * the claims it was minted with, so no amount of retrying this page can
 * ever succeed. Signing out and back in is the only cure, which is why
 * Sign out is the one action on this page.
