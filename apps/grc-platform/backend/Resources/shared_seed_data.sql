-- =============================================================================
-- GRC Platform — Shared Reference Data
-- Run this AFTER shared.sql, and before serving any traffic.
-- =============================================================================
--
-- Seeds the role catalogue, the privilege catalogue, and the mapping between
-- them, for both Risk Hub and Audit Hub. This is REFERENCE DATA, not sample
-- data: it is identical in every environment, it is coupled to the schema in
-- shared.sql and to the privilege constants in
-- backend/internal/shared/privilege/privilege.go, and the platform does not
-- function without it.
--
-- In particular, role.scope_basis is set ONLY here. Nothing in the Go code
-- writes it — grant_repo.go only ever reads it via COALESCE(scope_basis,'').
-- A role left with a NULL basis resolves to an empty one, and
-- grant.Set.SourceScopeIDs()/AssignmentScopeIDs() then match nothing, so a
-- team-scoped caller (e.g. a Risk Assigner on one register) sees ZERO risks:
-- handleListRisks takes its fail-closed empty-page branch and the grant axis
-- of riskVisibleToCaller never matches. Skipping this file does not degrade
-- the platform gracefully — it silently empties it for everyone except
-- GLOBAL holders and people named individually on a risk.
--
-- Prerequisites: shared.sql must already have run.
-- Run as: mysql -u <user> -p grc_platform < shared_seed_data.sql
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE keeps rows consistent,
-- and every migration statement is a no-op on a fresh database.
--
-- NOT INCLUDED — the bootstrap admin grant. On a fresh environment
-- user_role_grant is empty, so nobody holds MANAGE_USERS and nobody can grant
-- it. Seeding one grant is the only way in, and it names a real person, so it
-- is environment-specific rather than reference data. See the template at the
-- end of this file.
--
-- Role strategy:
--   Role names are owned by this platform — they no longer have to match any
--   identity provider's group string. Asgardeo authenticates users and nothing
--   more.
--
--   User-to-role assignment lives in user_role_grant, granted per scope. This
--   file seeds only the catalogue (which roles exist, and what each can do).
--   Everything else is granted by an admin through User Management.
--
--   role.module decides which scopes a role may be granted against:
--   RISK → GLOBAL or RISK_TEAM, AUDIT → GLOBAL or AUDIT_TEAM, SHARED → GLOBAL.
--
--   There is deliberately no all-privileges stand-in role. The former
--   'wso2-everyone' is deleted below: under scoped grants it would be a role
--   that is every module at once, holds every privilege, and would inevitably
--   be granted GLOBAL — defeating the entire model, and reaching production
--   because it is the easiest thing to grant when something does not work.

-- scope_basis is the load-bearing column here — see the file header. It says

-- (where the risk was raised) or ASSIGNMENT_TEAM (where the work was routed).
-- A risk_team row can be both a register and an assignment team, so the scope
-- id alone cannot say which sense was meant: "Risk Owner @ Asgardeo" means
-- risks ASSIGNED to Asgardeo, while "Risk Assigner @ Asgardeo" means risks
-- RAISED there. NULL is valid only for roles that are GLOBAL-only.
--
-- Note there is no longer a risk-action-owner role. Completing an action plan's
-- steps is authorised by being that plan's action_owner_id — the identity axis —
-- not by holding a role. An Action Owner may be any employee, including one with
-- no grants at all, which a role-based model could not express.

--
-- grc-platform-audit-compliance-team is module='AUDIT' too, but it carries
-- AUDIT_REVIEW_EVIDENCE (globalOnlyPrivileges in grant_service.go), so it can only ever be granted GLOBAL.
--
-- assignable_user_type declares which kind of person a role may be granted
-- to (INTERNAL/EXTERNAL identities live in separate Asgardeo organisations).

--
-- g.scope_type = 'GLOBAL' — only GLOBAL grants of the old shared role conferred

-- WHY THE created_at WATERMARK — this file is re-run in full on every deploy,
-- and there is no migration-marker table in this repo, so the statement must
-- carry its own one-time marker. The grc-platform-audit-management role row
-- IS that marker: it is created by this split and by nothing else, so its
-- created_at is the instant the split ran. Only grants that predate it are
-- eligible.
--
-- Without the watermark this is not a backfill but a standing rule: a
-- grc-platform-risk-management grant an admin makes NEXT MONTH — deliberately
-- Risk-only, since the split is what made that distinction expressible — would
-- be handed GLOBAL Audit Hub read on the next seed run, by nobody's decision.
--
-- `<` (not `<=`) because role.created_at is second-resolution DATETIME: a grant
-- landing in the same second as the marker is excluded rather than guessed at,
-- which fails closed.
--
-- ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is a deliberate NO-OP, not a reactivation. Re-running
-- must not resurrect a backfilled grant an administrator has since revoked —
-- that is the same unauthorised-privilege problem in a different disguise. The
-- assignment exists only to swallow the duplicate-key error; the row is left
-- exactly as the administrator last set it. It is table-qualified because the
-- SELECT's own user_role_grant alias makes a bare column name ambiguous.
