// Package entity provides HTTP-client implementations of the risk repository
// interfaces, backed by the Compliance Entity instead of direct MySQL access.
//
// Each type here mirrors one implementation in
// internal/risk/repository/mysql and satisfies the same interface from
// internal/risk/repository, so the two are interchangeable at wiring time.
// buildRiskDeps chooses between them per repository via RISK_ENTITY_REPOS
// while the migration is in progress.
//
// The entity's risk endpoints were written before the risk module existed and
// have never served a request, so where they disagree with the MySQL
// implementation the MySQL implementation is authoritative and the entity is
// corrected to match — never the other way round.
